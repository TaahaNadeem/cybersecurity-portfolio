# Taaha Nadeem – Cybersecurity Portfolio
  
Cybersecurity and Python projects built while preparing for 2026 Degree Apprenticeships — focused on practical learning, problem-solving, and real-world security skills.

This portfolio shows the Python and cybersecurity projects I’ve worked on — from small coding tasks to hands-on labs and certifications.  
I built this to show the skills and experience I’m developing while preparing for **Cybersecurity Degree Apprenticeships starting in 2026.**

## 💻 Python Projects

Practical coding projects that helped me learn programming, cybersecurity, and problem-solving skills.  
Each project was built from scratch to strengthen both my coding ability and understanding of security concepts.

### 🔑 Password Generator
**Description:**  
I created a Python script that generates strong, random passwords based on user input.  
It helped me practise using Python’s `random` and `string` modules.

**Tools Used:** Python, random, string  

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Generating secure passwords programmatically  
- Using Python’s built-in modules  
- Writing simple, readable code

### 🔍 Port Scanner
**Description:**  
I built a simple port scanner in Python that checks for open TCP ports on a target IP.  
I used threading to make it run faster and tested it safely within my home lab.

**Tools Used:** Python, socket, threading  

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Understanding TCP port scanning  
- Working with sockets and multithreading  
- Safe testing in a lab environment

### 🌐 Website Uptime Checker
**Description:**  
This script monitors whether a website is online and responsive using Python’s `requests` module.  
It taught me how to handle HTTP requests and automate simple uptime monitoring tasks.

**Tools Used:** Python, requests  

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Sending HTTP requests programmatically  
- Automating monitoring tasks  
- Handling and logging errors

## 🧪 Cybersecurity Home Lab

My home lab simulates a small attacker-defender setup using **VirtualBox**, **Ubuntu**, and **Windows**.  
Through this project, I learned how to scan networks, identify open ports, host services, and secure systems with Linux firewall tools.

**Overview:**
- Used Nmap to scan and identify open ports  
- Deployed a Python HTTP server on Ubuntu  
- Configured and tested UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules  
- Re-scanned with Nmap to confirm the system was secure

## 👤 About Me

I’m currently studying **BTEC Level 3 Applied Science** at **The Sixth Form Bolton (2024–2026)** and developing a strong interest in **cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and programming**.  

Over the past few months, I’ve been working on this portfolio every week to prepare for Cybersecurity Degree Apprenticeships starting in 2026.  
I’m aiming to join a company or university that offers **hands-on experience and real-world learning**, where I can keep improving my technical and problem-solving skills.

I enjoy learning by doing — building small tools, setting up labs, and finding creative ways to understand how things work in tech and security.
