## üîπ Cybersecurity Home Lab  
My Cybersecurity Home Lab simulates a real attacker‚Äìdefender environment using VirtualBox, Ubuntu, and Windows.  
This project demonstrates my ability to perform network reconnaissance, identify open services, and secure systems using Linux firewall rules.  

**Overview:**
- Conducted **Nmap network scans** to detect open ports and running services.  
- Deployed a **Python HTTP server** on Ubuntu to simulate a live target.  
- Configured **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** to restrict access and verified the protection using re-scans.
